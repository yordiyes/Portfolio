        <p>
          I am a 4th-year Software Engineering student at Haramaya University
          with a specialization in full-stack development. I have a strong
          foundation in front-end and back-end technologies, and I am passionate
          about building scalable and user-friendly applications. My skill set
          includes proficiency in JavaScript, React, Node.js, and MongoDB, and I
          have experience working on collaborative projects, contributing to
          open-source, and creating dynamic web solutions. I thrive
          in learning new tools and technologies, solving problems using data
          structures and algorithms, and delivering impactful software
          solutions.
